# Pollicy Fellowship - Supporting Materials

This repository contains a collection of my work aligned with Pollicy’s mission and the Francophone Community Engagement Fellow track. It includes writing samples in French and English, community engagement projects, creative content, and digital resources I’ve contributed to through various roles.

Please feel free to explore the folders to see my passion for feminist storytelling, inclusive community building, and tech for social good.

With care,  
Esther Sessenou
